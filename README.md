# Geographical_Hierarchy_Processor
**Geographical_Hierarchy_Processor** is a Python script designed to process geographic hierarchies with a parent-chile id system and add coordinates to location data.
It connects to a PostgreSQL database, fetches data using SQL queries, processes hierarchical relationships, and enriches the data with latitude and longitude using the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API.
The processed data can be saved back to the database or exported as CSV files.
